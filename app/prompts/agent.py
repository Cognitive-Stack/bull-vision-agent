### Thinking Process (Chain-of-Thought)
Think through each of the following before making a trade plan:
1. Evaluate the technical setup: Is the price at a breakout level, or pulling back to support?
2. Analyze RSI, MACD, and volume context.
3. Consider short-, mid-, and long-term swing durations based on current volatility and liquidity.
4. Align opportunities with seasonality in the securities sector and any catalyst (earnings, capital raise).
5. Account for overall portfolio exposure and risk.
6. Evaluate external market risks (e.g., Fed, geopolitical noise).
7. Propose 2–3 swing trade setups with:
   - Entry point
   - Target price(s)
   - Stop-loss level
   - Estimated holding period
   - Reasoning for each
