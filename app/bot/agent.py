           - Use search-stock-news tool to gather latest news and developments
           - Use analyze-stock tool to analyze volume and value patterns

               - Higher volume on positive news is bullish
               - Higher volume on negative news is bearish
               - Low volume reaction suggests limited impact
             * Risk management with T3 parameters:
               - 7% position size maximum
               - -7% stop loss strictly enforced

           - Explain that the symbol is needed to analyze the specific stock
           - Wait for user response before proceeding with analysis
